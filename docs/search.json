NA if the fish was not observed.\n“west brook” The mainstem (“West Brook” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“wb jimmy” Larger tributary that fish can move back and forth into from WB section 31 (“Open Large” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“wb mitchell” Smaller tributary that fish can move back and forth into from WB section 35 (“Open Small” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“wb obear” Smaller tributary that has a waterfall at its mouth, so fish can only move downstream into WB section 20 (“Isolated Small” from Letcher et al 2015).\nriverOrdered River the fish was observed in, ordered as a factor and renamed. NA if the fish was not observed.\n\n“West Brook” The mainstem (“West Brook” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“Open Large” Larger tributary that fish can move back and forth into from WB section 31 (“Open Large” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“Open Small” Smaller tributary that fish can move back and forth into from WB section 35 (“Open Small” from Letcher et al 2015).\n“Isolated Small” Smaller tributary that has a waterfall at its mouth, so fish can only move downstream into WB section 20 (“Isolated Small” from Letcher et al 2015).\n\ntag PIT tag number, unique identifier, character. Tags are 12-mm, full duplex. Biomark tags were used until 2002 (check this), and then replaced with Destron-fearing tags.\nnPerInd Number of electrofishing occasion observations per individual.\nsurvey “shock” = electroshocking survey. Retained here for compatibility with other data sets.\npass Electrofishing pass. 1 or 2 in the west brook (inside), 1 in tribs.\nnPasses Number of electrofishing passes for the section where the fish was captured. 1 or 2 in the west brook (inside), 1 in tributaries.\nproportionSampled Occasionally the sample was not complete (e.g., skipped west brook but did the tributaries). This is the proportion of sections in the river of capture that were sampled for the given sampling occasion.\nsection Identifier for the 20m section where the fish was captured. This is ordered from downstream to upstream ranging from 1-47 for the inside study area for the West Brook and from 1-14 or 1-15 for the trib area of the tributaries (river wb mitchell starts a -1 to accommodate the downstream PIT tag antenna). Above and below the inside study area in the West Brook, section numbers indicate the number of meters from the downstream or upstream end of the study area.\nlagSection Section number lagged forward one sampling occasion.\nriverMeter River meter from the confluence of the West Brook with the Mill River.\nsectionOriginal Original section number before renumbering. Maintained for compatibility with early data sets.\narea inside = section 1:47 in the west brook, trib = tributary (not west brook), below = sections below inside sections, above = sections above the inside sections.\ndistMoved Meters between locations for consecutive capture occasions.\nmoveDir Direction of movement between locations for consecutive capture occasions, -1 = downstream, 0 = same section, 1 = upstream.\ndetectionDate Date the fish was observed. POSIXct format.\nlagDetectionDate Detection date lagged forward one observation for consecutive capture occasions.\nyear Year of observation.\nseason 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter.\nyday Day of the year of observation [1-366].\nsampleName original sample name before renumbering. Maintained for consistency with early data sets.\nsampleNumber A tidier identifier for samples that strictly increases by one for each season (4/yr) and starts at 1.\nobservedLength Fish fork length in mm (+/-1 mm).\nobservedWeight Fish wet weight in g (+/- 0.1 g).\nlagObservedLength Observed length lagged forward one observation for consecutive capture occasions. NA if not observed.\nlagObservedWeight Observed weight lagged forward one observation for consecutive capture occasions. NA if not observed.\nlagSampleNumber Sample number lagged forward one observation for consecutive capture occasions.\nsampleNumberDiff Difference in sample numbers between consecutive capture occasions.\nsampleInterval Number of days between consecutive capture occasions.\ngrWeight ‘Instantaneous’ growth rate in mass. ln(lagObservedWeight - observedWeight) / sampleInterval.\ngrLength Growth rate in length. (lagObservedLength - observedLength) / sampleInterval.\nminSample Minimum (first) sample number for the individual.\nmaxSample Maximum (last) sample number for the individual.\nageInSamples Number of seasons since summer of the year of birth (1st summer = 0, 1st autumn = 1, etc.).\nisYOY Logical, is the fish a young-of-year (YOY)? YOY here are age-0 fish and age-1 fish in the spring. Age-1 fish are included because there is a very rapid growth in spring and we group smaller fish before rapid growht and older, larger fish.\nsex NA = unknown, f = female, m = male, p = precocious male (salmon only).\ncf Condition factor. (observedWeight / observedLength^3) * 100.\nrelCF Relative condition factor. (observedWeight / expectedWeight) * 100. Expected weight is calculated from the length-weight relationship for the species.\ndateEmigrated Date of emigration from the West Brook if observed to emigrate. Coded as emigrated if last observation was on PIT antenna at the top or the bottom of the West Brook or captured in area = below or above.\nmeanTemperature Mean temperature between observation dates. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlow Mean flow between observation dates. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByRiver Mean flow by river between observation dates hindcast from Jenn Fair’s model based on flow estimates from each tributary. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByArea_flowExt Mean flow by area (flow extension) between observation dates. Flow is from the flow extension model scaled by watershed area as a proportion of WB area. This is the flow value used in most West Brook papers before 2022. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByArea_ByRiver Mean flow by area (by river) between observation dates. Flow from the West Brook from Jenn Fair’s model scaled to tributaries based on relative tributary area. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanTemperatureScaledBySeason Mean temperature between observation dates scaled within season. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowScaledBySeason Mean flow between observation dates scaled within season. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByRiverScaledBySeason Mean flow by river between observation dates scaled within season. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByArea_flowExtScaledBySeason Mean flow by area (flow extension) between observation dates scaled within season. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\nmeanFlowByArea_ByRiverScaledBySeason Mean flow by area (by river) between observation dates scaled within season. If individual was not observed, median observation date for the sampling occasion was used.\ncomments Comments from the field crew during sampling.",
