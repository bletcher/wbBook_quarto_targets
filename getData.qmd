# Get data info

The database is now (as of 6/14/2022) on AWS. It can be accessed using functions in the 'getWBData' R package. Use `devtools::install_github('Conte-Ecology/westBrookData/getWBData')` (with VPN **off**) to install. Most of the functions will run reconnect() to connect to the server with your username and password (which you won't need if you have set up a .Rprofile file).\
Run `source("~/.Rprofile")` (with VPN **on**) and then `reconnect()` from the console to connect if necessary. Use `DBI::dbListTables(con)` to see the list of available tables on the server. Use `tbl(conDplyr, "table_name") |> collect(n=Inf)` to connect to a table.  Details about the 'getWBData' package are [here](https://github.com/Conte-Ecology/westBrookData/blob/master/getWBData/vignettes/getWBDataTutorial.pdf).

## Databases

We have two types of databases: *Environmental* and *Fish*

The *environmental* database contains daily mean temperature and flow data. Flow data are of 2 types 1) from a flow extension model - not tributary-specific and 2) hindcasted based on tributarty-specific flows from 2021 on (these flow variables are labelled '...byRiver'). Temperature data are from tributary-specific loggers.

There are four main *fish* databases we want to create:\
1. **cdWB_electro** West Brook electrofishing data, 3 species (brook trout, brown trout and Atlantic salmon), tagged and untagged fish\
2. **cdWB_CMR** West Brook electrofishing data formatted for Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) analysis for tagged individuals\
3. **cdWB_wanding** West Brook wanding (portable antenna) data, all tagged salmonids\
4. **cdWB_antenna** West Brook stationary antenna data, all tagged salmonids

"cd" stands for "core data".
